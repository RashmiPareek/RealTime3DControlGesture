# RealTime3DControlGesture
ROBOMINATI is a high-performance, interactive 3D particle engine that bridges the gap between digital art and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). By utilizing real-time computer vision and GPU-accelerated rendering, the project allows users to manipulate thousands of "stardust" particles using only their hands.
