# 🌌 Robominati: Celestial Air-Typer

**Robominati** is a real-time, gesture-controlled 3D particle engine built using **Three.js** and **MediaPipe Hands**. It allows users to "vibe code" in 3D space, selecting and shattering letters through intuitive hand gestures.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Air-Typing:** Move your hand horizontally to cycle through the alphabet.
- **Pinch-to-Shatter:** Use a pinch gesture (Thumb + Index) to trigger a physics-based particle explosion.
- **Interactive Environment:** Floating "Robominati" branding with autonomous robot companions.
- **Dynamic Physics:** 12,000+ particles handled via GPU-accelerated `BufferGeometry` for smooth 60fps performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Three.js:** 3D rendering and particle system management.
- **MediaPipe Hands:** Machine learning-based hand landmark detection.
- **GLSL / Math:** Parametric equations for letter sampling and explosion physics.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/robominati.git`
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Allow camera permissions and start "vibe coding"!
